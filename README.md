# **Radio Tower Detection using Mask-RCNN**


---



The aim of this project is to detect an Object in an Image using a [Mask RCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf) with a [ResNet101](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) backbone. The model segments the images creating masks for each object detected.
The implementation is a customized implementation of a [Pysource's public repository](https://github.com/pysource7/Mask_RCNN) using Python 3 and a COCO pre-built model.

The repository includes:

*   Source code of Radio Tower Detection with pre-trained weights.

*   Radio Tower Dataset with annotations.

The code is documented and designed to be easy to extend. If you use it in your research, please consider citing this repository (bibtex below).

# **Prerequisites**
---





 


The libraries needed can be found directly in the [Radio_Tower_Detection_Mask_RCNN.ipynb](https://github.com/aminefarez/Radio-Tower-Detection_Mask-RCNN/blob/main/Radio_Tower_Detection_Mask_RCNN.ipynb) notebook, they will be installed before training.

Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is recommended for this project.






# **Getting Started**


---






*   [Radio_Tower_Detection_Mask_RCNN.ipynb](https://github.com/aminefarez/Radio-Tower-Detection_Mask-RCNN/blob/main/Radio_Tower_Detection_Mask_RCNN.ipynb) Is the easiest way to start. It shows a step by step example of using a Mask R-CNN pre-trained model for Object Detection.
